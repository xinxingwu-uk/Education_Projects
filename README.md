# 🎓 Education Projects

This repository is a curated collection of **educational projects, interactive demos, and applied AI experiments** designed for teaching, learning, and exploring **modern computing technologies** in real-world contexts.

The projects emphasize **hands-on learning**, **browser-based interaction**, and **practical AI concepts**, making them suitable for:
- Undergraduate & graduate courses
- Self-learning and experimentation
- Demonstrations of applied AI and human-centered computing
- Curriculum design and instructional use

## 🌐 Project Themes

The repository spans multiple domains, gradually increasing in complexity:

### 1️⃣ Web Fundamentals & Interaction Design
- HTML, CSS, and responsive layout
- Visual hierarchy, typography, and UI composition
- Basic interaction patterns and event handling

### 2️⃣ Interactive Programming with JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and state management
- Animation, sound, and user-driven behavior
- Anthropomorphic programming (code that *appears* to speak, dance, or react)

### 3️⃣ Browser-Based Games
- Game logic and rules
- User input, animation loops, and feedback
- Educational use of games to teach problem-solving and computational thinking

### 4️⃣ Applied AI in the Browser
- Rule-based and decision-making AI (e.g., game AI)
- Client-side AI demonstrations
- Camera-based and interactive AI systems
- Foundations inspired by academic AI curricula (e.g., Berkeley CS188-style projects)

## 🧠 Educational Philosophy

These projects are designed with the following principles:

- **Learning by building** – every concept is reinforced through implementation  
- **Transparency over abstraction** – minimal frameworks where possible  
- **Human-centered computing** – interaction, perception, and user experience matter  
- **Applied AI** – AI as a tool, not a black box  
- **Future-ready skills** – aligned with modern industry and research practices

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Interaction**: DOM APIs, animations, audio, camera input
- **AI Concepts**: decision logic, heuristics, game AI, basic perception
- **Tools & Platforms**:
  - Browser-native APIs
  - Node.js (for selected projects)
  - Client-side AI workflows

No heavy frameworks are required for most projects, making them easy to run, modify, and teach.
