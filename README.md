## 🧠 Educational Philosophy

These projects are designed with the following principles:

- **Learning by building** – every concept is reinforced through implementation  
- **Transparency over abstraction** – minimal frameworks where possible  
- **Human-centered computing** – interaction, perception, and user experience matter  
- **Applied AI** – AI as a tool, not a black box  
- **Future-ready skills** – aligned with modern industry and research practices

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Interaction**: DOM APIs, animations, audio, camera input
- **AI Concepts**: decision logic, heuristics, game AI, basic perception
- **Tools & Platforms**:
  - Browser-native APIs
  - Node.js (for selected projects)
  - Client-side AI workflows

No heavy frameworks are required for most projects, making them easy to run, modify, and teach.
